# Version 0.0.8 - "Blast from the past"

Wouldn't it be nice to see your last entries and just know how diligent
you were with keeping a diary? Well, now you can! On the left side you'll
see the last 10 entries. You can even click them.

### Feature

* Show the last 10 entries on the left side.

### Fix

* Going back and forth between the days always triggered a save even when no change was made. And there was the
  possibility that one could overwrite entries.

### Internal

* Updated __a lot__ of packages
